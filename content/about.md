Hello, I'm Kevin Hoffman. You may remember me from such specials as [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.dev), [Cosmonic](https://cosmonic.com), or even some books I've written, including _Programming WebAssembly with Rust_, _Cloud Native Go_, _Building Microservices with ASP.NET Core_, and dozens more that are now outdated and irrelevant, or those two fantasy novels I wrote that no one reads.

This blog is a venue for my thoughts and ramblings that are unconnected to my professional outlets.
